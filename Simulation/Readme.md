Here we have introduced the second part for hotel check in process.
Apart from QR code scanner we will be having an IoT setup which will detect the presence of that particular user.
The setup will be installed above the door.
If the person comes near its room under the radius of 1 meter the sensor will detect his/ her presence.

While the process of hotel check in( i.e while scanning QR code) if the data gets matched and also the sensor detects the user's presence
then only the door will open with a message display "access granted".
In "access.png", when the user came under the range of human sensor you can see the automated doors are open( i.e servo motor 
angle is approx 90 degree) and lcd is displaying the message "access granted".

Similarly in "invalid.png", when the user is outside the range of human detector the automated doors are closed( i.e servo motor
angle is zero degree) and lcd is displaying the message "invalid".
