We have created a **mobile app** to open and close the door when the person will have hotel check in. This mobile app will only function when the app will 
be **connected to local server**.  

When the human sensor will detect(as shown in Simulation folder) the presence of user ,the microcontroller will give signals to Rpi
and will allow the screen to display the QR code as alloted to that room.
Then the user can use this app by login with the uniquely generated password at the time of hotel room booking.

**MIT 1.JPEG** := here user has to enter the correct password which has been provided to user by hotel manager during hotel booking.

**MIT 2.JPEG** := if the entered password will be correct then open and close (of door) option will pop-up.

**MIT 3.JPEG** := if the entered password will be Incorrect then open and close (of door) option will not pop-up.

**MIT 4.JPEG** := to open or close the door, user has to scan then QR code. if it matched then door will open/close.

**MIT 5.JPEG** := if scanned QR code will not match with user id then door will not open/close and "unsuccessful" message will pop-up.

**new_project.apk** := this is the mobile app which should be installed in user's phone after checking in. so that, there will be no need of physical key. 

**new_project_updated.apk** := In this app, we have improved the layout design and functionality so that user can easily understand the app and 
they can use this app comfortably.
