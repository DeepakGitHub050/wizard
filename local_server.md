2. server.py := python program running on RaspberryPi 


Here we have wrote a code in python to setup a local server on which user's phone will be connected.Acoording to the identification no. of user, a QR code will generate which will display on the perticular room for perticular user. When user will scan the QR code then only he/she will be allow to open or close the door. if scanned QR code will not match then that will not open or close.
Here I have taken one user's ID and according to that QR code is generated. 
Here Raspberry pi is acting as a server.
